"demonstrating that on average, participants in the collective identity condition contributed more each round than in the individual identity condition.",1
Such a choice pattern would have had a consistency level of about 50 per cent.,0
"These were: (a) reciprocation or contingency of the opponent's behavior upon one's own, (b) unilateral offers and initiatives, and (c) consistently honest communication of intentions.",0
In the previous review of the SP-IPD much of the theoretical framework of the measure was not presented.,0
We now lay out the hypotheses using the payoff matrix in Figure 1 to clarify some of the ideas.,0
"Fisher, Isaac, Schatzberg, and Walker (1995), for example, study settings with homogenous and heterogenous marginal per capita returns across group members.",0
"Of course since there was no feedback regarding others"" choices on ""earlier"" rounds, these five bids actually represent five ""one-shot"" prisoner's dilemmas, rather than an iterated dilemma).",0
Our findings thus far show that the sanction reduced the number of chips that participants allocated to themselves and that it only increased the number of chips allocated to the yellow pool when there were two options.,1
"Thus, whereas at first sight guilt merely indicates the presence of a repentant transgressor, other group members may indirectly profit from this emotional display because it may lead third parties to evaluate them as prosocial.",1
"In treatment T3, however, there is the possibility that highly cooperative groups could produce miscoordination if they cooperate at levels that are no longer supported in equilibrium.",1
"Therefore, the two sessions in Condition EG2 were combined, as were the two sessions in Conditions PR2.",0
"By recruiting an equally large male sample, it was possible to examine whether male participants would show a different pattern of results.",0
"This missing piece of information may lead subjects to estimate their counterparts' reputation to be lower than what they would do with more information, and therefore to decrease their cooperativeness.",1
"First, we can assess the correlation between beliefs and contributions, which we expect to differ between types of players and which helps us to check on the player type as elicited in the P-experiment.",0
"First, it is possible that a cooperative strategy reduces greed because greedbased actions are frequently justified through defensive assertions.",1
"Instead, I opt to take advantage of the natural tendency toward free-riding by increasing the number of periods prior to each stoppage while fixing the total length of the experiment.",1
We also conducted sessions with homogeneous groups of Colombian and American students to control for and compare base levels of cooperativeness in the two settings.,0
"Consistent with this tendency to operate according to personality type, many of the participants in my laboratory study were slow to change their behaviors when they were at low performing ranks.",1
"An irrigation cooperative is an example of what Ostrom (1990) called a common pool resource, which features a slowly regenerating resource pool that when harvested optimally, supplies some valuable resource without permanent damage to the viability of that resource.",0

"Instead, participants (n=27, 67% female, mean age=20.44",0
"Here, we will refer to the sequences of treatments in the same manner as in Table 3, which is portrayed again in Table 13.",0
Gumballs were used because their round shape allowed them to roll down the ramps in the apparatus.,1
Fehr and Leibbrandt (2011) found that fishermen in Brazil who are more cooperative and patient in lab experiments are also less likely to exploit the common pool resource in the sense that they use shrimp traps with bigger holes (where small shrimp can escape) and fishnets with larger mesh sizes (where only bigger fish are caught).,1
"Therefore, significant t-values in the models indicate that expectations significantly affect the probability of cooperation.",1
"The subject made his choice by setting a toggle switch on the lower right to either C or D, then pressing a button next to the toggle switch to register the choice.",0
"The added strategic incentives for weak reciprocity significantly increased the estimated reciprocity in both maintenance and provision (Fig. 3b, panel 1; multilevel mixed effects models, P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 4).",1
"If the harvesters in a commons cooperate by following quotas or use other means to regulate their catches, the resource will sustain a given yield indefinitely.",1
"In particular, high status individuals, by setting examples, can encourage particular behaviors among followers (Hermalin, 1998; Vesterlund, 2003).",1
Leniency and forgiveness seem to be motivated by strategic concerns rather than social preferences.,1
"However, rational proselfs will cooperate when it is in their best interest to do so.",0
"Because this analysis is limited to cases where two NE exist, we cannot theoretically identify the effect of increasing uncertainty on individuals' discrete choices.",1
"However, the experiment shows that communication causes cooperation to increase rapidly, reaching almost the social optimal amount of profits in some cases.",1
"Akerlof (1980) and Romer (1984), for example, argue that social customs are maintained by the social sanction imposed by loss of reputation when breaking the custom.",1
The result suggests that cooperative play in video games-whether violent or not-has the potential to improve cooperation in different circumstances.,1
"Upon entering the laboratory, the subjects were randomly assigned cubicles in which they were seated.",0
"A demand for behavioral norms arises when members of a group have individual incentives to take actions that reduce the group's overall welfare (James S. Coleman, 1990).",1
In other words such a player would be unwilling to receive an S payoff very often.,0
"Implicit evaluations are not only sensitive to individuals' goals, but also to situationally variable affordances.",1
Previous studies often show that unrestricted punishment can promote cooperation in public goods environments although restricted ones are more effective.,1
"One possibility would be that greedy people's continual striving for more would make them more sensitive to the magnitude of outcomes and less to the associated probabilities, leading to more risk taking.",1
"Thus, it is to be expected that the discontinuity eect will remain but will be reduced more in the successive than in the more uncertain simultaneous condition.",1
"The present findings fill this gap and, by so doing, suggest that groups are more competitive than individuals not simply because the intergroup context (and not the interpersonal context) renders salient group morality but because each context renders salient its own unique moral code, with group morality producing competition in intergroup interactions and individual morality producing cooperation in interpersonal interactions.",1
"Communication provides greater opportunity for cooperation, but that opportunity may either not be used, ineptly used, or used for deceit and vituperation [p. 22].",1
"In the latter, the citizens need only decide whether or not to provide an exogenously fixed level of the public good while in the former, they must decide how much, if any, to provide.",0
The building of an emergency sandbag levee by neighbors to protect their community from a flood has been important over the centuries.,0
"In the words of sociologist Granovetter (1995), economic transactions are 'socially embedded'.",0
"However, insiders cannot correct such free riding through directed punishment; indeed, the only option insiders have for hurting free-riding outsiders is to limit their contributions.",1
"The use of rewards and punishments is usually proposed as a means to promote cooperative choice behavior (Hardin, 1968;Olson, 1965).",1
"In this standard design, increasing m has two effects: first it increases the return to others from contributions to the public account, and second it lowers the private cost of those contributions.",1
Thus if subject A is more co-operative than B he will tend to lose in this situation.,1
"Therefore, institutional incentives are more powerful than peer incentives in promoting cooperation because the incentive institutions work although not all defectors are punished.",1
"In other words, we propose that even in situations where several people suffer from one individual's selfish behavior, most of the involved parties tend to be discouraged from punishing the selfish individual.",1
"If you choose , I will choose Whatever you choose now, I'll choose on the next trial.",0
These results illustrate how conversational dynamics can influence evolutionary signaling.,1
"SD = 1.29) and those in the ''many violators"" condition (M = 1.39;",0
"In 6 sessions with a total of 96 subjects, the VCM game produced 49 conditional cooperators who increased their contributions as the average of the others' contribution increased, 43 of whom also conditionally cooperated in the trustee game.",0
"That is, equality in outcomes becomes virtually irrelevant when outcomes for the self are positive and outcomes for the other are negative (or vice versa), because such a mixture of positive and negative outcomes represents large discrepancies between outcomes for the self and outcomes for the other in both options.",1
"However, contributions to public goods can be self-serving if each investor gains a disproportionate benefit from its own contribution.",1
"If the decision maker faces a finite number of possible opponents, the rule is incentive compatible in the cases where her subjective expectation corresponds to one of the outcomes that the aggregate choices of her opponents could possibly generate, but it is not incentive compatible for all possible beliefs that could be stated.",1
"The four payoff amounts presented in Figure 1 accompany, respectively, each of the four lights on the subject's matrix.",0
Types of communication that reduce cheating generally reduce the incentives to cheat.,1
In the first part of the experiment there is basically no difference in efficiency between the treatments.,0
"In particular, depending on how leaders formulate their messages they can also elicit distress by focusing too much on some negative aspects of followers' past behavior.",1
"This outcome suggests that if both the economic and the psychological contexts of decisions are carefully replicated, the laboratory can be used as an inexpensive way to test potential policy mechanisms.",1
"Accordingly, it is unclear whether the priming manipulations in those studies altered such perceptions, and if so, what associations there were between the relevant perceptions and the dependent measure.",0
"Although findings on this topic have been controversially discussed (e.g., Bushman, Rothstein, & Anderson, 2010;Ferguson & Kilburn, 2010), the most recent meta-analyses show that exposure to video game violence can have detrimental short-and long-term effects on aggressive and prosocial behavior (Anderson et al., 2010;Greitemeyer & Mügge, 2014).",1
"Institutions also frame whether a situation is cooperative or competitive, which determines which preferences and norms people apply.",1
"An additional analysis that investigated the relationships among decision frame, decision, and expectations revealed that the significant relationship between decision frame and expectations (F = 5.11, p < .05)",0
"Accordingly, new research is needed to unravel whether ingroup favoritism in situations lacking interdependence emerges because of social identity concerns, reputational concerns, or perhaps some combination of these two.",1
"Finally, we will explain how your earnings are calculated.",0
"Summary statistics Only pay-off relevant rounds are included, not the two training rounds at the beginning.",0
Your total income is the sum of the income from your private account and the income from the project account:,0
Our observation that angry subjects contribute less could be the result of a change in social preferences or a change in beliefs about the behaviour of others.,1
"They showed that a sanctioning system could undermine interpersonal trust, which can result in decreased cooperation in a similar social dilemma situation without a sanctioning system.",1
"As far back as the Upper Palaeolithic, we see evidence of large settlements behind defensive walls (Johnson & Earle 2000).",0
"The effect of actions by prior participants on the behaviors of subsequent participants was examined primarily in voluntary contribution experiments that examined how an initial voluntary contribution by a group leader led to contributions by others (Güth, Levati, Sutter, & van der Heijden, 2007) and experiments that examined how contributions by players informed about the value of a public good can positively influence contributions by uninformed players when such contributions are sequential (Potters, Sefton, & Vesterlund, 2005).",1
"Sure, I'd receive $9, but the fact that he received no money because of my selfish action I believe significantly outweighs the monetary value of $9.",1
Our results suggest that the competition scheme is attractive enough to gather sufficient support in a majority vote but not if individual groups are given a veto.,1
Mis-coordination tends to arise in networks where two players are symmetrically situated.,1
"In particular, in the S-treatment the anticipation of social reward and disapproval may become more salient in later periods leading to higher contributions in the final periods than under anonymity.",1
Mean proportions of competitive choice are presented in Table 1.,0
Subjects in position A play the role of a central coordinator in the star-out network.,0
"More specifically, anger will be instigated especially if the leader of the group violates equality, because the leader is expected to behave fairly.",1
"Third, narcissists may experience performance deficits over the long term that occur when the illusion of success interferes with obtaining real success (Campbell, Goodie, & Foster, 2004;Robins & Beer, 2001).",1
"In terms of the mechanism(s) that account for why we would expect happy music to facilitate cooperative behavior within groups, Study 1 focuses on the direct and independent relationship between listening to happy music and cooperating with others.",1
"They understood that rendering people interdependent, in the marketplace and elsewhere, increases the stakes they have in others' outcomes and thereby fosters the development of other-regarding motives.",1
"It may be that for fcmalc S's the Prisoner's Dilemma game is less interesting or important than for male Ss and consequently their cooperative and competitive acts conveyed very little meaning with regard to interpersonal feelings, Another possibility is that in behavior communicated to another person, females reveal less about their feelings toward that person and their own feelings are, in turn, less affected by the actions of that person as compared to malts.",1
"Though not as high as the theory predicts, proposer power is increased with the presence of a vote of confidence procedure, and proposers take advantage of that power.",1
This indicates that the behavior of each individual group could be accounted for reasonably by the main effects of prior experience and reward.,1
Cooperation thus tends only to occur if people are under the impression that they can trust one another.,1
"At least 2 factors may influence the emergence of cooperative behavior in this well-known collective action problem: the incentive structure of the game itself, and the intrinsic social preferences of each of the players.",1
"As predicted, there is a highly significant interaction between time pressure and experience (column 2, coefficient ¼ 0.350, P ¼ 0.008).",0
"The shift toward strategies of conditional cooperation in the framed games may indicate that people understood the framed game as a context where extrinsic motivations apply and the standard game as a context where intrinsic motivations apply, as Baumard implies.",1
"In the left panel, the payoff for player i is a function of his or her individual level of extraction under two scenarios.",0
"However, by cooperating, P also ensures that the gain to OP is 2 units (regardless of OP's choice): If P cooperates and OP cooperates, OP earns 3 units (rather than 1, if P had defected); if P cooperates and OP defects OP earns 4 units (rather than 2, if P had defected).",0
Our own speculation is that a kind of culturally imposed norm leads people who are strangers to each other to act guardedly.,1
"In natural settings, punishment occurs in various forms, for example, formal versus informal, public versus private, material versus symbolic.",0
"Figure 1 and Table 1 show that when the first mover keeps more than $7, directness is punished more harshly: Average punishment is greater when the first mover extracts rents directly, and many subjects punish in this direction.",1
"A total of 144 subjects, 72 of each sex, was assigned to promise credibility conditions of 10%, 50%, and 90%; reward levels of $5, $10, and $20; and simulated strategies which were either 50% or 90% cooperative over the 100 trials.",0
"Newcomers might pose a threat to the power structure of a group (Moreland & Levine, 1988;Ziller, 1965), the social identity of group members (Lois, 1999;Widdicombe & Woofitt, 1990) or the performance of a group (Ziller, Behringer, & Jansen, 1961).",1
"No partner (i.e., friend) effects were significant, although a marginal tendency emerged for participants whose friends reported higher initial liking to report greater final closeness to these friends.",1

"Since this time, human evolution has seen little change, as the hominid has been estimated to experience gene alterations every 100,000 years (Shepard, 1998).",0
"Those with larger endowments realize that their contributions will make a larger impact in earning the public good, increasing their motivation to contribute.",1
"It is anticipated here that in the absence of an established distribution rule (uncertainty), the division of resources among individuals in group and coalition distributions will be anchored by cues from the surrounding context.",1
"Perhaps because residents of the USA have a narrower, more localized view, they tend to contribute a much higher proportion to their local public good.",1
"The logic behind this is natural: It is cheaper to spur on members to make additional contributions when their impact on the group account return increases, since every single contribution will give rise to more positive externalities to all group members.",1
"More data, and possibly greater variation in the contributions of others, can be obtained by pooling decisions from repeated play.",1
Subjects might have inferred from the capable-but-failing partner's behavior that he or she disvalued the task or the performance incentive.,1
"One of the variations that may be well learned is that when groups are involved, competitiveness, or a max rel orientation is valued.",1
"Swingle and Gillis's finding can be explained by the optimality argument of Downing et al. (1968): if ""the other"" is consistently competitive, rational pursuit of own gain dictates reciprocated competition in the prisoner's dilemma game, which was used.",1
"We assigned players to groups of either 3, 4, or 5 people and remained fixed during the whole session.",0
Gürerk et al. (2010) hypothesize that punishment may not explain a cooperative equilibrium if players are inequity averse and the setting is such that the current ability to contribute to the public good is a fraction of total earnings from the game.,1
"Second, the present study only weakly corroborated a previous characterization of the effects of ingroup cohesion upon intergroup biases.",0
"Mediation analyses revealed a pattern of results that is consistent with the possibility that the role of social support was mediated by max rel, or participants' concern for maximizing the relative outcomes of their group.",1
The addition of this variable makes a significant contribution to the explanatory power of the decision-making model.,1
"In the standard condition, such a $5 loss occurs if an individual's contribution would be either deficient or redundant.",0
"While value domains are generally fuzzy concepts (Schwartz, 1994, p. 25), the values included in our Prosocial domain were largely consistent with Feather's (1991) Universal prosocial domain (equality, a world of beauty, a world at peace, inner harmony and freedom).",0
"Finally, taking into account the above-mentioned elements, Batson and colleagues (Batson, Ahmad, et al., 1999;Batson, Batson, et al., 1995) point out a third element.",0
"Unlike in our experiments, many real group members can simply leave the group for another, more welcoming group if threatened with exclusion.",1
The upper boxes both contained red doors; the lower boxes both contained green doors.,0
"Given the limited number of punishment instances after the first punishment stage, and because our main interest is to explore how the possibility of a feud affects altruistic punishment, we will henceforth focus our analysis of punishment on first-stage punishment.",1
"Equally, if a designated noncontributor were, for some reason, to go ahead and contribute, the contribution of each member of the designated set would not be critical, and there would be the opportunity for at least one designated contributor to free ride.",1
Thus individual uncertainty was reduced leading to a better transition process with more stable institutions.,1
The authors proved evidence of the superior performance of seed contributions for the reason that the challenge treatment outperformed both control conditions.,1
"The TPBG is sufficiently simple that most sessions were completed within two hours, even with chat, and play largely stabilized by the end of Round 20.",0
"The same brain functions appear to be involved in different cooperative settings, but to a much lesser extent when they involve synergy.",1
"Bliss and Nalebuff (1984) show conditions under which the probability of the public good provision converges towards unity with an increase in group size, and they prove there exists an equilibrium in which the lowestcost agent eventually provides the public good.",1
"Since priming was conducted at the supraliminal and subliminal level, it is possible that the situational cues may not be mediated by impressions of the partner but rather have a direct effect on cooperative behaviour (Bargh et al., 1996;Smeesters et al., 2003).",1
This suggests that punishment also triggers feelings of guilt and shame that induce individuals to behave pro-socially (Barr 2001;Fessler & Haley 2003).,1
"Given the opportunity to discuss the problem and coordinate strategies for 10 min before making their decisions privately, the subjects organized themselves by specifying the m contributors in a way that always resulted in an efficient provision of the public good.",1
The direct implication is that happiness is good for worker productivity and in turn good for firms' profits.,1
Third-party punishment game (Wave 6) TPPG: average proportion of endowment participants gave to the recipient as an allocator across the two TPPGs a,0
The fact that subjects who display a larger context-dependent change in connectivity between right DLPFC and pfffff reject unfair offers more frequently also suggests the possibility of a deeper understanding of individual differences in normative behavior in terms of connectivity differences between these brain regions.,1
"Games with the exact same objective structures produce different behaviour depending on the framing (Hoffman et al., 1996(Hoffman et al., , 1999)).",1
Higher coefficient for the current game in the second half would indicate that the subjects were learning to conditionalise more on the game (which imply less contrast effect of the previous game).,1
"Therefore, such knowledge may represent a strong motivation for potential members of a club to exert sufficient effort to reach a provision target.",1
"This idea has received criticism, however, by those who suggest that the speeded responses to fearful or threatening stimuli are due to the relevance of the stimuli to the individual rather than its negative valence (Sander et al., 2003;Brosch et al., 2007Brosch et al., , 2008Brosch et al., , 2010)).",1
Efficiency levels fall because the maximum earnings possible increase with carryover (due to higher endowments or MPCR levels in stage 2).,1
Participants were told a cover story that they were part of a large ongoing study in which they would be playing the role of proposer and they would make the decision about how to divide the money for 20 different receivers.,0
"Historically, women have taken on peacekeeping roles in groups (De Groot & Peniston-Bird, 2000;Goldstein, 2003), perhaps because they are more concerned with preserving group harmony (Baumeister & Sommer, 1997;Geary, 1998).",1
"However, the effect is moderately large (the probability of voting in favour of competition is 18.9 percentage points lower for risk-averse subjects) and the lack of statistical significance may be ascribed to the small number of subjects classified as risk averse.",1
"The increase-only mechanism helps prevent players from being free ridden, providing them with a kind of assurance.",1
"In Appendix A, we present an alternate model that accounts for  in-group preferences and can explain some of the behavior we observe.",0
Our statistical tests are all extremely powerful because the noise levels are moderate at worst and because the experiments usually have a minimum of 500 degrees of freedom for the error terms.,1
Three studies find that individuals high in self-reliance (vs.,0
This reduction in negativity may have increased the perceived effectiveness of the leader solution for the task difficulty group.,1
"In addition, they suggest several avenues for further investigation regarding the subcomponents of psychopathy.",0
"Given that tit for tat yielded greater outcomes than cooperative or noncooperative partners, and given that tit for tat has received considerable attention as a functional strategy, it is interesting to note that in social dilemmas in which locomotion is possible, tit for tat can do even better if this strategy is accompanied by locomotions to high interdependence rather than low interdependence.",1
"When a leader can allocate the benefits, the leader can incentivize workers by allocating benefits to those who contribute the most and withholding them from those who free-ride.",1
"Previous research reports that overall, internals are more associated with cooperation than externals (Boone et al., 1999a).",0
"The first four columns indicate the session number, the number of subjects that took part in the session, the location, and Group assignments remained constant for the entire session.",0
"This scenario holds virtually irrespective of b, only that for strong temptations to defect the clusters of cooperative players become larger, and accordingly larger is also the clustering coefficient presented in Fig. 3.",0
Communication coupled with mutual commitments provides such dictators with a failsafe way of cooperating.,1
Recent efforts attempt to explain differences in willingness to cooperate using social and psychological measurements.,0
"Consistent with sociological literature for off-line experiments, voice communication was found to have an extremely powerful effect on people's tendency to trust and cooperate with each other.",1
"Substituting (s i ) from Equation (3) into Equation (4), one obtains the approval variable as a function of relative contributions.",0
"Given the minimal costs associated with using passive, self-sacrificing cooperation in the iterated PD game, it is fair to suggest that older adults were more effective than young adults at managing conflict with the Selfish Stranger.",1
"As a larger degree naturally results in a larger transitivity, we calculate the expected value of transitivity given a certain network degree and a certain size in a random graph in simulations (10,000 iterations), and report the deviation of the observed transitivity from the expected transitivity (that is, observed transitivity minus expected transitivity).",0
"Therefore, the challenge, for the facilitator/researcher, is to keep the bubble safe, and effectively control the high number of elements present in the dynamics.",0
None of the main effects and interactions were significant.,0
"If participants in the simultaneous game play the zero contribution equilibrium with some positive probability, then the comparative static of the low-fixed-cost treatment should still hold.",1
"Finally, we measured support for two conditional strategies: emulation and counteraction.",0
"To a p-estimator in the 3-pcrson game, the probability of having both others pick C is p2, of only one C is 2p(lp) and of both D is (1p)2.",0
The increase is much larger and is highly significant when the refund bonus is 0.75 and in the late periods 31-60.,1
This has implications for the design of public policy where ranges of motivations are present.,0
 The belief version goes on to suggest that there may be certain assumptions built-in to our cognitive processing of social dilemmas that leads members of our species to systematically misunderstand (or disbelieve) some aspect of the experimental game.,1
"Complementing this preliminary evidence, the dissertation presents several studies that support the reverse appraisal proposal; in particular, the dissertation presents evidence that, when engaged in a social dilemma, people are capable of inferring, from emotion displays, how the counterpart is appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, further infer what the counterpart's intentions are.",1
3. To observe whether or not the time at which the motivational predisposition is gauged has any importance for the behaviour observed (Study 3).,0
"ur pilot experiments indicated that the realized duration of games, especially in the early repeated games, had a substantial effect on the subjects' cooperation rates.",1
"Mathematical models have indeed shown that the larger the group, the more unlikely it is that cooperation for public goods can evolve (Boyd & Richerson, 1988).",1
"We test asymmetric breadth by regressing the absolute values of the non-inertial adjustments conditional on steady/increasing payoffs versus payoff declines, controlling for session, phase, group, period and individual fixed effects with individual-level clustering.",0
"In particular, Results 1 and 3 suggest that, depending on the research question, the researcher may face a tradeoff: high incentives for exact beliefs increase belief accuracy but strongly incentivized beliefs may also bias contributions away from levels that would be observed were beliefs not elicited at all or only hypothetically.",1
Our experiments provide direct tests between the rapport explanation and rival explanations.,0
"We selected 106 participants, 56 males and 50 females, and scheduled them according to their availability.",0
"Then the participants made their decisions, received their payment, and were debriefed.",0
"On the other hand, in our experiment, the simple instruction that a partner is a computer agent caused our participants largely shift their behavior to offer defect actions.",1
"The term, guilt aversion, is adopted from Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) where they define a guilt-averse player as someone who ""suffers from guilt to the extent he believes he hurts others relative to what they believe they will get.""",0
"This is because consumers, under low efficacy conditions, may believe that there is ""strength in numbers.""",1
"Nevertheless, individuals may form beliefs about who sanctioned them based on who sanctioned others, and may attempt to counter-punish based on this information.",1
Your contribution decision will therefore depend on how much other group members contribute.,0
"In addition, the data showed that the subjects were more highly motivated to minimize differences in final outcomes in the case of equal time investments than in the case of unequal time investments.",1
"Numerous studies have reported that individuals are more likely to cooperate when they expect other group members to cooperate than when they expect others to defect (Dawes, fcfavish, & Shaklee, 1977;Messe & Sivacek, 1979;Messick et al., 1983;Talarowski, 1982).",1
"However, the results of this study indicate that when the slopes of the payoff functions are not equal, this assumption is violated.",1
"However, increasing reward does have a small significant effect on contributions and a larger significant effect on provision.",1
"the NPD as the number of players increases, but, in order to reach the benefit, one needs more people to cooperate.",1
"Behaviour in the dilemma has been investigated by social psychologists, who have found that reward structure can influence the degree of cooperation but that personality variables do not serve as reliable predictors of behaviour.",1
"With the Buss apparatus, Leventhal,'Shemberg 8 van Schoelandt (1968) and Leventhal 6 Shemberg (1969) found that women with traditional sex role values had higher aggression scores than women who did not confirm to traditional values when aggression was sanctioned by the situation.",1
"While we attribute the increase in contributions primarily to group size, we must note that other design features did not remain constant between treatments and may be responsible for the observed differences.",1
"Group, clearly putting all our money in the group investment is paying off because it's doubling our profit if we go it alone, Let's stick to putting all 10 E$ in the group account.",1
"In the unanimity condition, the sanction was only executed when it was requested by all three remaining group members.",0
Any more complicated reward or punishment technology would have made the choice task of the participants more difficult and would not have added important further insights.,1
Note: Correlations of r P 0.18 (N = 129) or r P 0.14 (N = 200) are significant on p < 0.05.,0
This indicates that some realizations (depending on l and b) of the coevolutionary game give rise to compact clusters of players.,0
All effects other than subjects' gender are far from significant in the Mosuo data.,0
"According to this view, an 'irrational' impulse would lead the punisher to disregard the future consequences of punishing norm violations.",1
"Scodel, Minas, Ratoosh, and Lipetz ( 5 ) and Minas, Scodel, Marlowe, and Rawson (4) have demonstrated that the Prisoner's Dilemma, when played as an iterated game, results in both players employing a noncooperative strategy.",1
The intuition behind the proposition is straightforward.,0

is significant heterogeneity across members in the benefits from group activities.,0
"Although no large difference between the original and reactive model was found when explaining the behavior of human participants in the current experiment, we would predict a larger difference in the behavior of these two models under circumstances where the other player changes its behavior.",0
"Recently, Stith and colleagues explored situational stress factors for couples that met the criteria of situational couple violence (Stith, Amandor-Boadu, Miller, Menhusen, & Few-Demo, 2011).",0
"By playing a sequential game, it is possible to separate the effect through preferences from the effect through beliefs.",0
This time the initial network was a small-world network with an average nodal clustering of .71.,0
Hump-shaped contributors have the same conditional contribution pattern as conditional cooperator up to some maximum point and then negative correlation based on the same criterion as for conditionally cooperating behavior.,0
"Much has been written about the impact of climate change on resource conflicts (Ember and Ember 1992, Mwiturubani 2010, Downing et al. 2014;Harari and La Ferrara 2014, unpublished manuscript).",0
"The pattern of results in Fig. 1D is very similar to the one reported by Nalbantian & Schotter (1997), who found that with equilibrium contribution close to the upper bound of the strategy space mean contribution levels were stable over trials but somewhat below the equilibrium level.",0
"We find at least some evidence that giving in the trust, public good and dictator games, and reciprocity in the trust and ultimatum games vary over the menstrual cycle.",0
"The Pareto-optimal request and contribution level, shown in the left panel of Table 1, are the same across the three treatments.",0
