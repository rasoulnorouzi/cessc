Permitting continuous rather than binary ''all-or-nothing'' contributions significantly increases contributions and facilitates provision.,1
Another point worth noting is that the common resource dilemma paradigm we used was a single-trial setting.,0
Outcome Matrix Applied to Each Round of the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma Game,0
It is thus necessary to control for individuals' attitudes toward risk. 3,0
"Conversely, when switching from short games to long games, participants immediately begin to cooperate at a high level.",1
"Interacting with others in large populations without structure greatly reduces the likelihood of cooperation (11), but in a fixed social network cooperation can evolve as a consequence of repeated interactions because of ""social viscosity,"" even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity (1,2).",1
"In two villages, which had high success in JFM, villagers' social preferences were reciprocity, while in three other villages, which had moderate to low success in JFM, villagers' social preferences were commitment.",0
"The resulting increase in group distinctiveness can be expected to affect group perceptions (Spears et al., 1985;Acorn et al., 1988;fcfonnell et al., 1994) and ingroup favoritism should generally increase with salience of the ingroup (see the meta-analysis by Mullen et al., 1992).",1
"The intuition is that in that case there always exist strategy combinations in which a single (pivotal) player's investment in monitoring causes an increase of the MPCR above 1, transferring the public into a private good and making the investment profitable and, as a consequence, making positive investments in monitoring individually rational.",1
"Marginal effects are shown, with standard errors in parentheses.",0
Two sample trials were also provided to help illustrate the purpose and rules of the game.,0
"Secondly, the experience of conflict may create or deepen ingroup identity, strengthening other-regarding preferences toward in-group members and making it more attractive to cooperate within groups.",1
"Thus, they understand that they need to cooperate among themselves if they want to earn money.",1
"Likewise, in model 4 the net effect of the minimum contribution to the public good in the first round (minf1) remains significantly negative even in the final period. 8",0
Each figure presents a specific communication and voting scenario.,0
"If the goal-transformation hypothesis is correct, then the behavior of proselfs should be affected more strongly by the type of identity that is salient (personal vs. group).",1
"high contributors"" is negative and differs significantly from zero (at a 1%-level), again.",0
"In the game, a leader usually emerged and the leader's pleadings for cooperation were harder to ignore because all the players had experienced the results of greedy play.",1
"Moreover, all previous studies employed repeated prisoner's dilemmas in which conditional cooperation is the most profitable strategy; none have used one-shot dilemmas, in which non-cooperation is the most profitable strategy (but which nevertheless elicit substantial levels of cooperation in general-population participants).",0
Our experiments have led us to conclude that cooperation rates can be radically affected by one factor in particular.. . .,1
The presence of such a leader tends to increase coordination.,1
"An examination of histograms of scores for each condition suggests that people tended to lapse into either full cooperation or full defection in the no communication condition, which greatly increases the variance of the condition.",1
"Participants who have the first turn invest significantly more than participants in downstream positions, using Mann-Whitney tests.",0
"Thus, we compare people who hold the evoked identity to people who are familiar with, but who do not hold, that identity: if identity is important in the current effects, those who do not hold the evoked identity will not be affected by identity-salience manipulations.",1
"The group's average contribution across periods 1-16 (""Contribution P1-16"") has a significantly positive impact on the probability of appointing a leader in period 17 and in period 21.",1
"At the opposite, people do not have a strong adverse reaction to external regulation and follow the elected rules because there is a general and specific trust that others will also follow the rules.",1
The youngest and oldest subject groups displayed higher levels of voluntary cooperation than the middle group which is believed to face more competitions.,0
"The payoff of the lottery ticket depended on the result of a toss of a fair coin with ""heads"" resulting in a payoff of two dollars and ""tails"" resulting in no payoff.",1
The relatively high willingness to invest in local public goods with long-term benefits invites to rethink the optimal level of donor control on aid funds.,1
"Otherwise, if the accumulated gain explains the behaviour of the birds but the one trial gain does not, then the birds are making decisions based on the four trial reward and are playing a mutualism game.",1
"Hence, we propose that darkness should only promote cooperativeness when the interaction partner also cooperates.",0
"If it is considered 'fair' to contribute to a public good, perhaps because others are also doing so, then many people will be prepared to make voluntary contributions.",1
"For any k ∈ {2, 3}, λ > λ, and c ∈ (c * ck (λ), g], r(c) > 0, so that F ck (c, λ ) < F ck (c, λ), so (a) follows.",0
"Thus, a leader who dislikes disadvantageous inequality would tend to opt for NEG as an incentive scheme.",1
"After ensuring that the child was not acquainted with his opponent, the game was explained very carefully to each child.",0
"However, there are also reasons to think that the treatment will lead to low contributions, since the reaction to the comprehension/advice combination may be defensive.",1
"On one hand, these findings partially confirm our speculation vis-à-vis the role of risk taking: reciprocators were not necessarily cooperators under conditions of uncertainty, as some of them chose to cooperate because they could bear a high risk in anticipating the counterpart's goodwill.",1
"For example, resource dilemmas are best resolved when there is communication between group members (Messick, Allison, & Samuelson, 1988), when a sense of group identity or solidarity exists among group members (Brewer & Kramer, 1986), or when education is given regarding the long-term benefits of cooperation (Allison & Messick, 1985; for further reviews see Komorita & Parks, 1995or Van Lange, Liebrand, Messick, & Wilke, 1992).",0
"An awareness of God may have also activated the fear of supernatural punishment as a consequence of defecting and not cooperating (Johnson 2005;Johnson and Kruger 2004;Johnson, Stopka, and Knights 2003).",1
"Sessions lasted approximately one hour, and subject earnings averaged £9.05 in the United Kingdom and $12.66 in the United States. 7",0
"It is the combination of chronic, self-protective mistrust with hyperactivated affi liation that leads to inconsistency and increased decisional effort.",1
"Although we expected behaviour in the trustee role to be value-expressive, universalism was not a stronger predictor of behaviour in the trustee role than in the proposer, responder, or truster roles (all contrasts t(1079) < 1.48, all p > .1).",0
"We also found that institutions are associated with the marginal effects of diversity: Diversity reduces contributions to public goods as expected, but only when students come from segregated institutions.",1
Liebrand et al. (1986) concluded that cooperators may place a higher value than individualists on how well an interaction satisfies personal or social behavioral standards.,1
"Because participants generally cooperate withand rarely defect againstcooperators in the iterated PDG, the resulting distribution of the number of rounds participants cooperate tends to be severely non-normal.",1
"For both these reasons, along with the frequently large size of the effects we observe, dynamic partner updating deserves to be considered among the most promising levers for eliciting cooperation between humans, especially in informal settings.",1
We assign α i = 4.5 to these subjects.,0
"In sum, the content analysis of communication provides further evidence that conflict expenditures in OPEN are lower than in the other treatments because subjects discuss and successfully implement turn taking behavior between groups.",1
"Regardless of the sum of the fi ve numbers, there was a complete uncooperative behavior in the one-bad-apple condition (the eff ect of the bad apple).",0
"The results show that uncertainty per se lowers individual but not group contributions, lagged marginal incentives significantly predict contributions, and individuals significantly react to own-deviations from average group contributions.",1
We characterize the relationship between our artifactual and framed field experiments as similar rather than identical because by necessity some differences exist in the two implementations.,0
People who sacrifice on behalf of others like themselves are more prone to the self-interest illusion because they see the benefits as going to people who are like themselves in some salient way.,1
Behavior in the experiment will support the hypothesis that moral opinions are conditional on the behavior of others if subjects report personal normative beliefs increasing in the average contribution level of group members.,1
Any violations of sphericity assumptions were corrected for using the conservative Greenhouse-Geisser correction.,0
Result 3. The choice of receiving feedback about individual earnings rather than about individual contributions is associated with a decrease in one's contribution in the next period.,1
"When the subject is faced with positive contribution to the public good by the computer, cooperative behavior can also be driven by inequality aversion and conditional cooperation.",1
"Generational differences, maturation, and cultural shift imply that stereotype activation should not affect Millennial entitlement because the change in entitlement occurred in the past and is observed retrospectively.",1
The upshot of this discussion is that any equilibrium with co # 0 implies using almost no communication (separation of types) in the first stage.,0
"In contrast, if the negativity bias argument applies to the VCM setting, then these two ratings may produce asymmetric levels of cooperation, as predicted by the hypothesis.",1
"Unless otherwise specified, all subjects who posted a hostage cooperated on the subsequent move, and all subjects who declined to post a hostage defected on the subsequent move.",0
"The similarity between single-player and multi-player versions of the IPD can provide a powerful research model as the reduction from two to one players reduces the number of uncontrolled and interacting variables involved in the prisoner's dilemma (Fantino, 2004).",1
"Because we use two observations per individual, we adjust the standard errors for clustering on individuals.",1
The authors contributed equally to this research.,0
"Collectively, these informal sanctions provide a powerful mechanism for guiding social behavior.",1
"So, ceteris paribus, we expect that Flemish people will not become less but ratherif there is a difference at allmore cooperative in French language contexts: H2.",0
"However, when access is equally distributed, group members will be more willing to act in a way that advances the interests of the group rather than just their own (i.e., they will be more cooperative).",1
"The contextual effects caused by the mean, range, and rank of the distribution confirmed our expectations that these relativity effects are due to some general underlying cognitive mechanisms.",1
The study adds to the existing literature on connection between real-life preferences and preferences in experiments.,0
"Since participants in these studies preferred an alternative that maximized the joint gain of both communities, the results obtained from Studies 3 and 4 also supported these predictions.",0
"Fourth, cooperation and trust are not related to affiliation tendencies, but strongly related to betrayal aversion.",0
"The reasoning is that in high-trust societies, most people already contribute to the public good: The belief that most others can be trusted renders punishment an unnecessary cost to encourage contributions.",1
Their earnings from such a decision would depend not only on their individual extraction but also on the extraction levels that the other members of their group made in that round.,0
"Such patrols not only deter free riding in itself but also generate information needed for the punishment of free riders, which is determined by an executive committee on the group level chaired by the group leader.",1
The gains or losses incurred by the players on each trial are dependent on choices made by both of them between two available behaviors.,1
"Depending on the parametrization, this new game can have egalitarian equilibria as well as asymmetric solutions, leaving one player worse off.",1
"t(94) ϭ 1.78, ns), a significant reduction (Z ϭ 1.98, p Ͻ .05).",0
"Subjects in the Generalized Reciprocity group always faced cooperators: first five Hindus, then five Muslims.",0
"Although the SSRIs are much more selective, chronic treatment with compounds such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have been found to induce changes in noradrenergic transmission in both animal and human studies (see, for example, Lundmark et al. 1994;Redrobe et al. 1998).",0
"After completing the questionnaire, subjects were debriefed, thanked for participating, and excused.",0
"When players have the option of punishing each other after the contribution stage, the effect of the moral messages on contributions becomes persistent: punishments and moral messages interact to sustain cooperation.",1
When numerical cheap talk was combined with a punishment option there were many cheap talk threats of punishment and cheap talk responses with higher cheap talk contributions.,1
"Based on this belief, the difference between public goods and common-pool resources has often been reduced to frames or different representations of one and the same game.",0
"We again found that social context, this time the level of competitiveness, did not fundamentally change the dynamics of cooperation.",0
"Consider Pruitt and Kimmel's (1977) goal/expectation theory, which states that cooperation is more likely when trust is enhanced, but only if people also have a prosocial orientation (the goal to achieve mutual cooperation), if the trust explanation is true, then people with a prosocial orientation should contribute more when group identity is salient.",1
"It makes no sense to spend large amounts of money for summer salaries, secretaries, computer terminals and research assistants, and then motivate the subjects with microscopic amounts of money (quoted in Kollock 1998:207). 11",0
"Second, deviation from the dominant strategy leads to a higher joint payoff for the group, and enough contributions produce an outcome that is Pareto superior to the dominant strategy equilibrium outcome.",1
"Based on the above reasoning, we predicted that individuals who anticipate pride about acting fairly would be more likely to divide resources between themselves and another in a fair way, whereas those who anticipate regret about acting fairly would be less likely to do so.",1
"In the PD game the players simultaneously choose their moves -C (cooperate) or D (defect), without knowing their opponent's choice.",0
"Cooperative corporate culture can be nurtured by starting small, as Weber (2006)  shows experimentally with a coordination game.",1
"Then ,Z t (x). is evaluated as an average of Z t k (x) over all the 26 couples.",0
"In models based on income differences, if responders care for the utility of the other responder, then in addition to receiving disutility because the take authority has a higher income than they do, they will also receive disutility because the take authority has higher income than their friend does.",1
We did not obtain saliva samples from two participants because these two participants were short-termly recruited and not screened in advance for health and smoking absence (final N = 58).,1
This study's null result is disappointing.,0
"Such a preference structure is consistent with a preference structure that resembles the payoff structure of the Prisoner""s dilemma, DC > CC > DD > CD.",0
The effect of partner type did not differ across treatment groups for the probability of cooperating after a partner defection.,0
Participants were told that a total of 200 lottery tickets would be divided among all participants.,0
"In fact, a recent agent-based simulation also suggests that gossip-based partner selection increases cooperation, whereas the strategy to defect after knowing about free riders' reputation decreases cooperation 18 .",1
"When early humans used dogs as hunting partners, they most likely increased their intake of protein (Koster & Tankersley, 2012;Ruusila & Pesonen, 2004).",1
"Concerning the contributions in the mechanism treatment, Fig. 7 shows rather stable and marginally increasing contributions over the course of time.",0
"Due to this base rate, no conclusive verdict for a no-play option facilitation effect at high base rates can be drawn.",0
"We found that communication still improves group performance even with increased difficulties in communication and limited information about the resource, but the level of benefit for having communication is reduced.",1
A second problem is that many of these experiments gave false feedback to subjects about their partner's choices.,0
"If it is true that antisocial punishment is based on the intuitive system and especially likely executed by individuals with a proneness to sadistic tendencies, then the inhibition of the intuitive system should reduce antisocial punishment in individuals with a proneness to sadistic tendencies.",1
"The def change having occurred prior to the verbal response trial (B 2 ) suggests that negative attitude change, after harm, may inhibit retaliatory behavior  for Group DL and, to some extent, for Group N.",1
"In conservation psychology, the accumulated evidence indicates that people's conservation performance is strongly determined by normative prosocial influences.",1
"During donation choices, peer presence resulted in higher donations and enhanced activity in several social brain regions including the muff, TPJ, precuneus and STS.",1
This finding is consistent with publicly-traded firms making relatively larger investments in environmental performance to assuage the concerns of investors.,1
"A decrease over time is consistent with game-theoretical predictions about conditional cooperation, since individuals are expected to eventually modify their behavior over time to maximize their earnings.",1
"In a highly congested road, for example, at peak hours commuting car drivers are not willing to share the road or let other vehicles use the road space correctly, exacerbating the tragedy associated with the overuse of that road space, even if this is highly inefficient.",1
Members will only observe the total amount invested to the group he belongs.,0
"While the behavior of subjects in the low-reward conditions is more ambiguous, it is congruent with the speculation that persons are not highly motivated to do well in the PD game when earnings are small, irrespective of the extent to which the rewards are equitable.",1
"In contrast, increasing individuals' awareness of their mortality apparently leads them to base their donation decisions on the social desirability of providing help, as reflected in the amount of help provided in the past (Experiments 1-3) and others' preferences (Experiment 4).",1
The first conjecture refers to the potentially positive effect that leadership signaling per se may have in catalyzing cooperation.,1
"Given that our study was run only in one location, we cannot infer much about the effectiveness of sanctions in other locations when using the same weak link technology.",0
"For example, regardless of their own contribution students could not be excluded from the public good that the course generates (i.e.",0
"This implies that there are signs that moving beliefs may have been one of the channels through which priming affected contributions, but this channel seems to be surprisingly weak and statistically insignificant.",1
"If the memory advantage for expectancy-incongruent information is abolished under cognitive load, our ability to successfully engage in social cooperation would be impaired because this type of memory is essential for correcting maladaptive behavior tendencies.",1
"In discussing the nature of prejudice and discrimination, Allport (1958: 78) summarized much evidence and concluded in a generalization that &dquo;on the average, attitudes toward Negroes are less favorable in southern than in northern and western states.&dquo;",0

"Evidence for the in-group compensation hypothesis comes from the significant three-way interaction between partner group, partner action, and participant identification.",0
"Cook and her colleagues examined another condition of PD/D in which two players were randomly matched in each trial, and found that the positive effect of the opportunity to separate trust and cooperation provided by the PD/D requires that the game be played between particular partners repeatedly.",1
"It might be the case that the resources contributed by the group members be as costly as resources arriving from outside of the community, but when states have limited funds and personnel, and when communities can derive other kind of gains from, say, participation in self-governing systems, such as increase in trust, social networks and ties, the comparison of externally imposed regulation systems to self-governance deserves also a policy level inquiry.",1
Participants were informed that the task would involve two players.,0

"In this line of thought, individual utility arise not only from material outcomes but also from the comparison of own and other people's pay-offs.",1
"In an attempt to instrumentally maximise their outcomes, the very same underlying individualistic motive will propel parties to opt for non-cooperation in single-trial PDG interactions, but to choose cooperation in iterated interactions.",0
A natural explanation for the limited capability of a leader's signal to influence followers' beliefs under heterogeneity is the lack of followers' trust in the relevance of the signal to participants who do not share the religion of the leader.,1
"In other words, a dictator is more likely to make a fair offer if he/she expects the audience to observe their choice.",1
"By taking the view that a confluence of individual and contextual factors induces aggressive behavior, we explore how individual proclivities for aggression and environmental circumstances conducive to aggression e neither of which are particularly rare in isolation e must co-occur to create the comparatively rare expression of aggressive behavior.",1
Identities were elicited through short survey questions.,0
"A trigger strategy, s*, can be characterized as a strategy of cooperation that is followed if the following three conditions are met: First, at time t, it must be the case that",0

• Disparities between WTP/WTA in valuing environmental benefits: The literature on the differences between a willingness to pay for an environmental benefit versus a willingness to accept compensation for giving it up continues to confirm the hypothetical bias and loss aversion effect that we were warned about decades ago.,0
The refined approach builds on key tenets of social identity theory to argue that identity affects cooperation by leadings actors to maximize ingroup outcomes and minimize ingroup inequalities.,1
We propose that it is because task-related and task-unrelated communications activate different norms.,1
"This is evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that the Perfect Strangers treatment affects qualitative behavior, in the sense that it elicits more subjects to focus on the zero contribution response.",1
It is therefore possible that the higher rates of cooperation in PD are (partly) due to the smaller size of the action set.,1

"Specifically, we expect authority contribution leaders to give more than randomly selected contribution leaders both because they recognize the positive influence that they can exert on others and because more of the mechanisms that make contribution leaders influential may be relevant when a local authority leads.",1
The points accrued during the experiment would be traded for lottery tickets with cash prizes between £10 ($20) and £30 ($60).,0
People may voluntarily contribute to a public good because they feel morally obligated to assist others in a common cause or because they realize that contributing will help the group as a whole.,1

It was concluded that the high degree of competitiveness typically found in PD game studies may be largely a function of the isolation imposed on the subjects by the experimenter.,1
"Without data on both expectations and contributions, it can be difficult to identify the strategies adopted by participants in economic games, a necessary step to test fully theories of cooperation.",1
"Large coalitions mean few outsiders but, at the same time, high free-rider benefits if the coalition members fully internalize their mutual benefits.",1
"If there were no time value, then there would be no advantage to hiring an agent first (since the other party would respond by hiring an agent instantaneously), and therefore a prisoner's dilemma could not exist.",1
"Second, the absence of an effect of Openness might also be driven by statistical reasons, due to the structure of the MPT model: Parameter e is defined conditional on non-selfish behavior, which leads to fewer trials per person (and hence a lower statistical efficiency) for the estimation of parameter e than for parameter s.",1
"It is the product of an evolutionary game in which intragroup cooperation enhances one's reputation within the group (Yamagishi & Mifune, 2008).",1
"If participants in the Public Goods Game exhibit loss aversion, they will react more strongly to the prospect of being punished than to potential rewards; thus making punishment the more effective enforcement mechanism.",1
"The probability of 0.2 is chosen conservatively, since this data generating process gives slightly more noisy classifications than we really have: 32% of the generated data points have two and 4% have three possible levels.",0
"The interpretation of the relative sizes of these two effects, however, has to be made with caution, since effect sizes depend on the parameters used in the experiment, including the cost and benefit for cooperation and the cost and size of punishment.",0
-This test was developed on the present study sample and certainly needs cross-validating (now in progress).,0
"Consequently, the payoffs of free-riders in SFI decrease and over the periods, participants in SFI experience the typically observed collapse of cooperation in repeated social dilemma interactions (Fig. 1).",1

DISCUSSION Our hypotheses were all confirmed.,0
Table 4 summarizes players' choices in the early and later trials.,0
Participants in this sample completed the 7-item DGS.,0
"Of course, young and older adults were both likely to create an obstacle to their partner's goal when they interacted with friends than with strangers.",0
"We find that in the presence of conditional cooperators, common knowledge does enhance efficiency mostly because the advice left in this treatment is more exhortative.",1
"The game master read the instructions twice and I then demonstrated the play with a set of ten, ten shilling coins.",0
"But many indicated an interest in having both players choose D (Table 6), which is closely related.",0
"Further, as the game scenario of the current study equalled classical iterated Prisoner Dilemma Game (PDG) matrices, mentalizing performance was measured implicitly thereby circumventing socially desirable behaviour [18][19][20]24,25].",0
This improves the earnings for those groups but the lowest earnings are not too different and this pulls the overall average earnings down to look more similar across treatments.,1
"In our study, because of the presence of a sanctioning system, it may have occurred to people that group members would defect if it were not for the sanctioning system.",1
"Even though the level of regulation a facility faces does not depend on the overall size of a facility, the two factors are highly correlated.",0
"The maintenance of social norms often depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly.",1
"Our elicitation was very specific: beliefs about the other three players, paying for exact correctness, and beliefs were elicited before the decision.",0
"Threat of revenge induce more deliberation on punishment and reduces other perverse punishment, which will have a positive impact on cooperation.",1
"Specifically, we used three boxes of different sizes (small, medium, and big), each of which contained a different set of gifts.",0
An important consequence of this increase in average effort is that the aggregate monetary payoff increases by 40% even if one takes the payoff reductions that result from actual punishments into account.,1
There is a strong and significant correlation that those subjects who burn money tend to be also those who expect their counterpart to burn theirs.,0

"Thus, moral judgments were an effective and efficient mechanism for fostering cooperation, solidarity, generosity, trust, and trustworthiness.",1
"The members of such societies have strong incentives to innovate and to make physical and human capital investments, thereby contributing to socio-economic prosperity and overall welfare.",1
"As can be inferred from Table 2, most of these relationships were rather weak (with 6 trivial and 15 small associations).",0
"A player using this strategy cooperates initially, and then plays the same as his/her opponent did in the previous game.",0
"First, the most notable feature of our results is that in all cases the treatment effects are smaller in the replication than in the original study.",0
"Emotional energy is, thus, the result of both the euphoria of contagious public gatherings, the ecstasy of sexual encounters, the bonding of friendly exchanges, and it is an outcome of humiliating experiences, heated arguments, and violent episodes.",1
Violent media may cause viewers to perceive greater anger and less gratitude during a cooperative task and as such be less inclined to cooperate.,1
"When the objective incentives remain identical, these studies showed that framing the dilemma in terms of ""taking from"" instead of ""contributing to"" increases cooperation (Brewer and Kramer, 1986).",1
"This interpretation was supported by the results of Study 2, which directly tested subgroup reputation as a moderating influence on organizational identification.",0
We find differences in the behavior of our experimental participants across the three countries and we find that Hofstede's dimensions help to explain these differences.,0
"Research also shows that when people adopt a more abstract or higher construal level (Trope & Liberman, 2010)-that is, they feel more psychological distance-they show more pro-self-orientation, leading them to engage in behaviors that fit with the social motivation they endorse (Giacomantonio, De Dreu, Shalvi, Sligte, & Leder, 2010).",1

"Through such mechanisms, a deliberation treatment might increase cooperation in the second stage of a sequential prisoner's dilemma, contrary to the prediction of the SHH.",1
"However, the non-monotonicity between observability and deterrence we observe is troubling, because it suggests that simply increasing the ability to monitor outside threats may not lead to better outcomes, and it leaves us unsure about what level of observability is required to generate better outcomes.",1
All your answers will be treated confidentially and anonymously.,0
Despite the interesting balance of incentives provided by introducing competition in the workplace -on one hand individual workers may exert more effort to win promotion or make more money while on the other overall production might suffer because of the lack of cooperation among workers -there has been remarkably little empirical work estimating the effect of competition on workplace cooperation.,1

They were told that they would participate in a number of unrelated experiments and were brought to individual soundproof cubicles.,0
"When everyone has made a choice, the outcome and the choices of the other members of your committee are revealed, and this determines your earnings for the match.",1
"More specifically, the MCL may be higher in the VCM with real-time contributions simply because people tend to contribute more when they are observed, even if the observers' actions are not affected by this monitoring.",1
"These were participants with little or no experience from economic games, because, according to the SHH, there will be a negative deliberation effect on cooperation only for subjects with limited experience from economic games and other ""artificial lab environments"" (Rand et al., 2014).",1
"This earlier experience, we find, causes the players to update their expectations, leading more groups to choose the tipping game compared to the treatment in which groups lack this experience.",1
The negative trend in contributions in blue groups is substantial and statistically significant.,0
"Acting for sacred values, collectively, provides a record of cooperative action and thus offers evidence of cooperative responses downstream.",1
"In other words, acceptance would be more common if the subjects' expectations were met because, although a shared concept of fairness exists, fairness is sensitive to different factors (personal, situational, and social) that influence expectations and fairness perception.",1
"Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare.",1
Locus of control fosters cooperation for internals with high levels of cooperative education because those people are able to use their background as a means towards an end in that they believe that they can influence their desired outcomes.,1

The eight games were played in different rooms to minimize sequential dependencies.,0
"However, as an adaptation of beliefs to feedback is likely to occur, we may expect in line with the adaptive conditional-cooperation conjecture (Neugebauer et al. 2009) that the contributions positively respond to the past continuation-payoff differential.",1
"Thereafter, participants in this condition immediately moved on to the remainder of the study.",0
"The very existence of a government that can promulgate and enforce regulations to deter free riding while acting as a faithful agent of its citizens depends on voluntary pro-social acts such as citizen scrutiny of politicians' actions, self-education about political issues, and making the effort to vote in elections.",1

They produce evidence to support the notion that a greater MPCR distance increases contribution by making the gains from cooperation in the social dilemma more salient for all group members. 18,1
The groups convened in separate adjacent classrooms to prevent communication between groups.,1
"A possible explanation is that the cooperation norm is more salient in the former than in the latter, due to the fact that in ""public,"" everyone observes punishments for norm violations.",1

Results demonstrate that awareness tools providing information about highly cooperative group members encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of being exploited.,1
"Having said that, various features of our design work to inhibit the importance of an experimenter demand effect, including not using a senior PI as the experiment administrator and limiting social interactions between subjects and the administrator to those required to conduct the experiment.",0
"The results of this study suggest that while it is true that people with an altruistic or cooperative orientation will participate more than those with an individualistic or competitive orientation, their participation is likely to be reduced if they observe other membersÕ defection behavior.",1
This study examined the flexibility of prediction and decision making in the face of a partner's differing level of theory of mind.,0

natives and the resulting payoffs may change in time) are interrelated in the sense that the changes in the reward structure and the sequence by which different conflicts are entered depend upon the way previous conflicts were resolved.,1
Note that allowing frequent network updates does not necessarily mean that the network structure actually changes frequently but only that the opportunity for change often exists.,0
"Nonetheless, we feel that it is worthwhile showing that the extra step of instrumenting for received messages does not affect our main conclusion: there is a causal relationship between receiving an explicit threat and cheating on collusive agreements.",1
"However, self-deception could also vary as a function of the situation and may be a facultative mechanism.",1
The uninformed player's payoff comes close to the theoretical prediction in most cases.,0
Self-conscious emotions do this in several ways.,0
"In our opinion, the easiest and most parsimonious way to take them into account in our experiment is by asking directly about satisfaction with other players' behaviour in the CPRG and testing how much it matters vis-à-vis objective characteristics in the second TG.",0
"When people perceive a relationship partner as highly agreeable, they feel more comfortable resolving conflicts (Jensen-Campbell et al., 2002) and are more inclined to solve conflicts through informal mechanisms (rather than including a third-party mediator; Morris, Leung, & Iyengar, 2004).",1

Simulation results indicate the importance of ethical behavior on the long-term financial success of companies as well as the larger industries in which they participate.,0
Punishment is generally lower when the target was the highest contributor in the group and this effect is stronger for actual than for requested punishment.,1
"In this paper, we neither attribute behavioral differences between the 'elite' and the rest of society to endowment differences nor to self selection (a positive correlation between selfishness and endowment); rather we hypothesize in line with Cote et al. (2015) and Heap et al. (2016) that the inequality in the society itself makes elite members more selfish and less generous.",1
Hypothesis 2: The presence of a threshold constraining participants' activities will lead participants to be less holistic in their cognitive orientations than when a threshold is not present.,1
"In 2001, the Court ruled in United States v. United Foods, Inc. the mushroom checkoff program unconstitutional because it was a stand-alone checkoff advertising program and not part of a broader set of economic regulations.",1
"In these experiments, which allow subjects to punish non-cooperators at a cost to themselves, the moderate levels of contribution typically observed in early play often rise in subsequent rounds to near the maximal level rather than declining to insubstantial levels, as in the case where no punishment is permitted.",1
The results suggest that remembering an experience of rejection can trigger anger and ruminating on being rejected can trigger indirect aggression.,1

"Specifically, when anticipated barriers lower the probability of successfully achieving one's interests, individuals should be more inclined to opt for the benefits of competitive actions.",1
"The results of these groups show a crystal-clear picture: Participants overwhelmingly elected the best candidate in the absence of conflicts, but once competitive ''bribes'' were introduced, knowledge-sharing broke down, and the groups failed to pool information and to uncover the objectively best candidate, so an inferior candidate was elected in more than 80% of these elections.",1
"Similar to the main effect of time, post-hoc Bonferroni tests (at p < .05)",0
We can once again interpret these data as demonstrating that in this context it is the social nature of information which influenced behavior toward others.,0
"This impression was reinforced by pair-wise comparisons indicating that participants who underwent the TÀ treatment on study day 1, and who showed relatively reduced number of cooperative responses, significantly increased their cooperative responses after the T + treatment on study day 2, while participants who underwent the T + treatment on day 1 showed similarly high levels of cooperation on day 2.",1

"Participants were allowed to discuss their decisions with the other group members for up to three-minutes, three times during the task, namely, prior to trials 1, 4, and 7. Communication among group members frequently occurs in real-work settings, and has been shown to promote cooperation in social dilemma situations (e.g., Kerr & Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994;Komorita & Parks, 1995).",0
The difference between the group-representative and group-all condition was interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of norms requiring cooperative behavior.,1

"At the end of the round, subjects were informed of each other's choices and received a payoff corresponding to the action pair.",0
We use an experiment with multiple threshold public goods to show how increasing the number of public goods vying for funding can decrease both total contributions across all goods and the probability that any public good receives enough donations to succeed.,1
These two questions are closely related to the different fairness models.,0
"In the context of the present experiment, the conjecture of ""indecision by indifference"" would imply that subjects that are quoted a monetary reward that is sufficiently close to their maximum willingness to pay would find the decision more difficult and therefore require more time for a decision.",1
"Spurred by this theoretical explanation of the evolution of cooperation, many researchers looking for such signals in humans have focused on involuntary facial expressions of emotion (Boone & Buck, 2003;Brown & Moore, 2002;Frank, 1988;Krumhuber et al., 2007;Mehu, Little, & Dunbar, 2007;Oda, Yamagata, Yabiku, & Matsumoto-Oda, 2009;Scharlemann, Eckel, Kacelnik, & Wilson, 2001;Trivers, 1971).",0

"For the present purposes, we opted against counterbalancing, due to the demands that this would have placed on the number of different sequential arrangements, as well as a balanced distribution of young and old girls and boys.",1
"The larger this bias, the stronger the effect of ignorance on norm compliance.",1
"A meta-analysis of sex differences in cooperation showed that both men and women's levels of cooperation are different in mixed dyads vs. same-sex dyads and, while it is often assumed that women are more cooperative, female-female interactions seem less cooperative than malemale interactions (Balliet et al. 2011).",0
This forwards the interesting and paradoxical hypothesis that inducing the unpleasant feeling of guilt in a fellow group member may in itself be beneficial because it actually allows one to build a reputation of being a cooperator (cf.,1
"In all three models, the coefficient of the treatment dummy ""last"" is not significantly different from zero, indicating no differences in propensity to cooperate between cumu-lative and last.",0
Results show that tax publicity reduces both the number of evaders and the amount of tax evaded.,1
"Thus even if the correlation between first-and second-mover choices is best explained by a consensus effect, a complete explanation of the data will require some preference element that rationalizes second-mover cooperation.",0

"On average, all players, independently of the decision protocol, group size, and re-matching procedure, send positive amounts.",0
"While less information leads to more equal contributions, subjects focus on group efficiency in case of full information.",1
The fothfun mechanism thus leads to less cooperation than in the baseline case with no punishment if the detrimental effect of retaliatory punishment is greater than the positive norm-enforcing effect of punishment.,1

This unpredicted interaction may have happened due to collectiveness created by the community title.,1
"Considering the relatively smaller groups (4 and 10 persons), they find that size only matters when the return on the public good is low, in which case, contributions actually increase in large groups.",1
"And the more a participant contributes, the less he or she earns.",0
"Thus, because an elected leader refl ects the choice of the group and its members, an elected leader will feel strong support from the followers who will bestow on the leader a high sense of social responsibility ( Julian, Hollander, & Regula, 1969;Kenney et al., 1996).",1

"A second experiment demonstrates that when electoral delegation must be endogenously implemented, individuals voluntarily cede authority to an elected agent only when preplay communication is permitted.",1
"d = .92. 3 Due to the modest sample size for examining moderately highly correlated predictors in regression, we examined correlations to determine the most likely predictors of interest for future research.",1
"Consistent with our second hypothesis, which predicts that relationship duration mediates the impact of tie strength on cooperation, we find that both the main effect of tie value and its interaction with the number of tie swaps are diminished, relative to Model 2. The main effect decreases by 64% (from −.069 to −.025), and the interaction with the number of tie swaps decreases by 65% (from .029 to .01).",1

"Inversely, (2) when students have academic curricula with high levels of background knowledge related to the root causes of environmental problems and the related possible strategic options, the cooperative-competitive context does not matter.",1
", because we did not expect impressions to play an important role as an antecedent of cooperative decision-making and cooperative behavior is rather the result of the direct influence of SVO (Heon individuals) or primes (Leon individuals), we did not expect a systematic relationship between cooperative behavior and impressions (Hypothesis 6).",1
"Namely, at the end of a repeated public good contribution game, if a surprise announcement is made that the same group of subjects will play another repeated game, contributions initially jump back to a relatively high level and then decrease again over time.",1
"Subjects who did not see the pool size drop tended to vote against the elimination of free access to the commons, whereas subjects who did see their pool size drop voted to relinquish free access.",1

"As mentioned above, in condition II, participants had no risk of losing money, which eventually leads to greedy incentives for the participants.",1
"In a first paper, we put Knack and Keefer's conjecture that inequality destroys ""social capital"" to a direct experimental test, but found no evidence whatsoever in support of it: the observed level of cooperation was independent of the implemented degree of inequality (Sadrieh and Verbon).",0
"The greater are others' contributions, the less is one rewarded, ceteris paribus -perhaps because there is little scope for either punishing or rewarding in groups in which all are contributing close to the maximum.",1
But since the payoff for mutual defection is smaller than the payoff for mutual cooperation (fwo) the dilemma arises on what to choose if having in mind also the welfare of the society and not just personal interests.,1
"This interpretation suggests that if the factors that weaken the case for the dominant or competitive choice were eliminated in the repeated-play PD, the prescriptive behavior would be obtained.",1
This conclusion is further supported by the results of a recent study by Evans and Crumbaugh (1966).,0

"As is argued in the literature, the effects of these punishments are clear: cooperation is established and maintained Sefton, Shupp & Walker (2002).",1
We used this proportional measure of punishment rather than the raw amounts that participants spent for punishing each trader because the total amount that they spent for punishment varied among participants.,1

"Interestingly, another body of research concerns a situation wherein group discussion does not promote increased cooperative choice (Insko et al., 1987;1988).",0
"The follow-up independent t-tests (Table 1) revealed that MAOA-L carriers exhibited significantly lower beliefs about others' contribution in stage one (P~0:013), stage two (P~0:037), and stage three (P~0:039), but not in stage four (P~0:421).",0
"We find that third parties punished more frequently, severely and less antisocially, resulting in a higher contribution level than that driven by second-party punishment.",1
"Thus, subjects with a stronger VTA response to CC outcomes at baseline experienced the largest OT-induced decrease in VTA response to CC outcomes.",0
"However, it is important to note that the results from a survey of a nationwide representative sample of Swedish parents' attitudes toward child care (Biel et al., 1997) were successfully replicated in experiments similar to those reported here (Eek et al., 1998).",0
Result 3. The threat of inter-period feuds in LF reduces the frequency of altruistic punishment relative to the Baseline treatment.,1
An extension of the model in (1) by adding terms b ih jx hj À y hj j could capture such preferences.,0
"We consider nondivisibility to be the more important factor in determining individual members' willingness to contribute to the provision of the public good, because it directly affects the value of the good to the individual.",1
"To see this, take periods 1 and 2. In period 1 a subject can rely only on his or her intuitive (""home-grown"") beliefs about others' contributions.",0
"The 'degree of imperfection' of this information clearly increases with the size of the group, because it becomes increasingly difficult to decompose the responses of other subjects into their reactions to the simultaneous changes in the contributions of their counterparts.",1
"The development of inequality aversion relatively early in childhood is particularly interesting in the light of ethnographic evidence that suggests a strong role of egalitarian ""instincts"" in human evolutionary history.",0
"The increase in average contributions for the US region in RN (29.8) relative to ON (26.7) is due to the fact that, in ON, 64% of American participants opted for the principles of future polluter-pays and equal percentage reduction of current  emissions, both of which are synonymous with the smallest public good contribution; conversely, in RN, 62% of Chinese participants selected the principles of equal per capita entitlement to emissions and historical polluter-pays, the equity principles that denote the largest contributions for the US region.",1
Fig. 3. Distribution of actual and expected transfers in the dictator game.,0
"In contrast to experiments where reputation is information about behavior in previous periods of the game, our experiment contains an endogenous reputation system.",0
Our findings also showed that participants' scores on a Prosocial value domain derived from Rokeach's terminal values were indicative of their cooperation preferences in the PGGs.,1
"To investigate this, we calculated for each participant the monetary consequences of his or her decision for the group (see also Table 1).",0
"It may well be that if a group fails in establishing the public good, a self-sacrificing leader may be evaluated as poor since his or her efforts did not prevent the group from failing.",1
Payoff structure for the modified Iowa gambling card-selection task,0
"Because we conjectured that the opportunity for punishing would have a larger impact if subjects could learn about the behaviour of other group members, we repeated the basic public goods gameÐwith and without punishment opportunity, depending on the treatmentÐfor six periods.",1
"Consequently, emotional responses from past exchanges influences the behavior of actors in the future.",1
Our studies suggest that sometimes coordination can be easily promoted by simply pointing out to people that certain information is available to all people involved.,1
The analysis of variance further revealed that all subjects anticipate that with a leader the distribution of harvest outcomes over the group members will be more equitable than in the first part of the experiment.,0
Tooby & Cosmides (1996) propose that the establishment of stable and friendly relationships between group members favoured the exchange of help when needed and thus reduced the risks of the situation described by the banker's paradox.,1
The main aim of this article was to investigate to what extent groups use reputational information to assess the suitability of candidate members.,0
It is possible that people's ability to estimate the equal choice may decrease as the number of others with whom they are sharing a nonpartitioned resource increases.,1
The mixed-motive interdependence situation was presented to participants in the form of a decision-making task.,0
Virtually all instances of social exchange in the ancestral environment were likely face-to-face.,0
"In other treatments, participants know the amount of the potential loss but have no information about the probability of the loss and its potential reduction through contribution.",0
"Importantly, the minor differences we observe are not systematic.",0
"It is important to keep in mind that a carefully drawn, well articulated theory is indispensable in drawing scientific conclusions from experimental observations.",0
"Lastly, because greedy people are never satisfied with their current state of affairs, it is likely that this affects their wellbeing in a negative way.",1
The rationale for this finding is unclear.,0
The consequence of these two evolutionary forces is that in equilibrium strong reciprocators and purely selfish humans coexist.,1
which is ultimately an empirical question.,0
"We find that contributions are 56.6% higher when group composition is different across both public goods dilemmas as compared to when composition is the same across the two public goods dilemmas (M 1 = 17.7,",1
"The procedure in the leader treatment was similar except that in this treatment, one of the participants was selected to be the leader for all rounds to be played in that treatment.",0
"Hypothesis 1b: In fragmented villages, there will be higher frequencies of cooperation in H-H/M-M than in H-M.",0
"In the case of defaults, an endowment effect may be at work: people may perceive the default option as something they possess and, thus, place more value on it.",1
"Thus, if the default effect is partly explained by information conveyance, we expect to find it less pronounced when the default contribution can be a randomly drawn number over the support of choices in the game.",1
"If one (or more) of the players is ""competitively oriented,"" he continues to exploit the other player or players until they must respond with self-protective noncooperation as well.",1
Rather than imitating an other who adopted a noncontingently cooperative strategy subjects exploited the simulated other.,0
"Our results show that emotion-regulation knowledge is itself neither positive nor negative, but can facilitate the objectives of individuals whose interests are in doing harm as well as those interested in benefiting the greater good.",1
"From the pool of 105 one-shot PDG players, we selected 64 players whose pictures were without photographic deficiencies; faces that were not entirely framed or faces that were partly covered by hair, garments, eyeglasses, or hands were excluded.",0
"The deviation of actual from the predicted (minimum number of) s = 10 observations is (33 − 29)/33 = 12.1% which seems small enough to consider Hypothesis 1 reasonably accurate and, formally, we cannot reject that the share of subjects with β i > 0.5 is the same as the share of subjects offering s = 10 (p = 0.580, Fisher's exact test).",0
"[nc The intelligent management of common resources (e.g., groundwater, fish, wildlife, forests) raises some thorny issues for social scientists.",0
"First, the task of learning and familiarization was harder, since the first choice of rules occurred before subjects had any experience interacting in a VCM with or without punishment.",1
"Thus, representatives successfully advanced the interests of their constituencies when bargaining with persons who did not have constituencies of their own.",1
One possible reason for the difference between these two studies is that learning effects are more likely to overwhelm the effects of pair IQ in longer games; this may be related to the finding that worker IQ is a stronger predictor of performance in the early months on a new job while IQ's predictive power for worker performance weakens after years spent in the same job (Hunt 1995).,1
Unconditional contributions by round and VCM round contribution type.,0
"If imperfect information reduces the incentive to match others' contributions, both the matching rates of actors with relatively high marginal benefit functions and those with relatively low marginal benefit functions will tend to fall.",1
"Thus, nobody will ever know what you have done.",0
"Potlatches and other excessive public charitable displays suddenly begin to make sense when they are viewed as selfpresentation strategies (default, 1992).",1
"Finally, looking at a group average measure of connectivity that we calculated, we find high correlation with individual cooperative behaviour.",0
"This finding is reminiscent of Sniderman et al. (2004), which found that perceived threat to safety was the least important predictor of hostility towards immigrants in the Netherlands.",0
The inclusion of asynchrony allowed a player to act independently of his opponent; this provided an opportunity to double-cross him.,1
"Variations on these early dominant strategy public goods games have been conducted in the laboratory under many different assumptions about utility functions and technology, different subject pools, asymmetric endowments and preferences, different information conditions, different public good mechanisms, variable group sizes, and so forth.",0
"The second insight is that the inefficiency observed in heterogeneous groups is not only due to the inefficiently low levels of contribution, but also due to a relative underuse of rewards.",1
"Since the motorization of fishing boats in the early 1930s, competition among fishing units for access to the shiroebi stock has become a chronic problem.",1
