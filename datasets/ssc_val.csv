"We predicted that in absence of a sanctioning system, people would show little support for a sanctioning system unless there is collective inefficiency, and that in presence of a sanctioning system, people would support the sanctioning system, irre-spective of the information people have concerning collective (in)efficiency.",1
"If industries can relocate easily, then the level of pollution would depend on the country with the weakest environmental regulation.",1
"It serves people's short-term self interest not to contribute to the establishment of an authority, but if none or only few group members cooperate there will be no authority in place to monitor the good, and therefore the good may fail to be provided.",1
"More interesting, however, is that the Sanction × Options interaction effect showed that the sanction increased the collective outcomes only in the two options condition.",1

"As one individual increases his or her effort, the personal payoff increases regardless of other individuals' actions (the left panel); however, as the aggregate effort of the other individuals increases, the payoff for that particular individual decreases (the right panel), more clearly demonstrating the negative externality.",1
"In many social-game protocols, ranging from gift-exchange over ultimatum bargaining to public-good situations, human behaviour differs substantially from the Nash-equilibrium that results if we assume that players care only about their own monetary payoff.",1
These results suggest that the shared outcomes involved in cooperation did increase cohesiveness.,1
"In two behavioral experiments, we offer individuals the latter possibility: Participants can work together to increase the total size of the pie and hence increase the size of their own slice.",1
"The alternative model predicts the following predictions: P 1 : When there is no tax imposed, individual contributions will exceed 5. P 2 : When a tax of 3 is imposed, total individual contributions will exceed the individual contributions made when there is no tax imposed.",1

"However, previous research showed that SVO, measured a substantial amount of time in advance, still affected behavior in the predicted ways (e.g., mcclintock & Allison, 1989).",1
"Furthermore, due to this TFT strategy, we cannot observe how a participant in the scarcity condition would respond to defection on the part of their partner; our program defects only if the participant is the first to deviate from cooperation.",0
The discrepant levels of attention paid to music in relation to consumer behavior and employee or organizational behavior are most clear when considering retail workspaces because (i) customers and employees cohabit the locations and (ii) it is reasonable to expect that music that is selected to influence the behaviors of customers would have similar influences on employees.,1
""" 5 contexts lead actors to rely more on contributions to the group than competitive contexts, while competitive contexts lead actors to rely more on punishment of others than cooperative contexts.",1
"Furthermore, the highest contributor in the group earned more prestige when the good was unattainable, suggesting an association between status and conspicuous cooperation (Hypothesis 3).",1
"As a consequence, confounding effects such as reputation building through punishment or strategic reasons for punishing to increase cooperation in repeated interactions, as shown by Gächter et al. (2004) and Gächter and Herrmann (2009), can be excluded and a clear theoretical benchmark for standard preferences can be derived.",1
We argue and show that an important reason why people apply the do-no-harm principle to their use of sanctions is because they feel personally responsible for the harm done.,1
"The institutional mechanism implemented in Study 1 is richer than an ultimatum game and simultaneously changes the incentive structure depending on the priors of the participants: if players believe that others will contribute at levels just above the lowest current contributor, and believe that others believe this, pure self-interest will generate the observed ratchet pattern.",1
"Fear is associated with the goal to avoid risk, which in a social dilemma induces a tendency to avoid exploitation or loss.",1
"This implies that conflict increases parochialism both by increasing preferences for in-group cooperation, and by decreasing preferences for out-group cooperation.",1

"Replications with people from other age groups or nations would help to establish the generalizability of these findings, which is important to do because researchers have suggested that apologies and offers of compensation are species-typical ways of promoting forgiveness (e.g., fcfullough, 2008;fcfullough, Kurzban, et al., 2010).",1
"Compromise Effect Task Statistics by Riskiness for Experiment Three The table gives the percentage of trials in which participants chose the compromise, most risky, and least risky lotteries respectively; this uses the results from all five decision problems.",0

"Selfish players may choose to reveal private information through costless and non-binding communication or cheap talk; such revelation can lead to efficiency gains, as shown by Crawford and Sobel (1982).",1
"It relies on the idea that people react to unfair intentions by sacrificing a part of their payoffs in order to punish others, even when there are no reputation gains from doing so (Rabin 1993;Falk and Fischbacher 2006).",1
"If this is the case, a was found above and in previous work (e.g.",0
"Because the approach of pausing first-order collective action for multiple punishment stages has been explored extensively by others and because situations that it may fail to mirror well strike us as common and important, we study higher-order punishment in a repeated play dilemma game with the constraint that the number of punishment stages not exceed the number of contribution stages by more than a factor of two.",1

The order of the experiment (whether experiment 1 was run first or second) did not significantly affect within-group cooperation (all p > 0.27) and thus this factor was not included in the analyses presented below.,0
The absence of an end-game effect or of a negative time trend in these groups is remarkable and offers evidence that unobservable sanctions can have a long-term impact on cooperation.,1

Competition for access to mates could indeed select for cooperation.,0
"The extent of individual cooperation tends to be higher among high-identifying individuals, either because they place greater value in the good itself (De Cremer & Van Vugt, in press;Kerr, 1996), because they have greater trust in the cooperative intentions of fellow group members (Brann & Foddy, 1987;Brewer & Kramer, 1986;Kramer & Brewer, 1984), or both.",1

"Our result suggests that the selfish prediction is prone to deviations when the equilibrium results in unequal distributions of payoffs, and there are alternative outcomes that increase both equality and the payoff of the disadvantaged party.",1
"However, we believe that excludability can (and does) provide an effective, low-cost way to induce cooperation, increase efficiency and support team production in social dilemmas and related situations.",1
"When people do not know the victims and have little if any positive regard for them, their donation behavior may be influenced primarily by criteria that they apply independently of their feelings of sympathy or empathy.",1
